    "    - Binary Log Reg requires the y to be binary with 1 representing the desired outcome.\n",
    "    - Only meaningful variables should be included (Regularization)\n",
    "    - little/no multicollinearity (_independent_ variables)\n",

    "- .fit() parameters:\n",
    "    - C : float, default=1.0\n",
    "        - Inverse of regularization strength; must be a positive float. Like in support vector machines, smaller values specify stronger regularization.\n",

    "        - 'liblinear' is limited to one-versus-rest schemes\n",
    "        - For small datasets, 'liblinear' is a good choice, whereas 'sag' and 'saga' are faster for large ones.\n",
    "        - For multiclass problems, only 'newton-cg', 'sag', 'saga' and 'lbfgs' handle multinomial loss; 'liblinear' is limited to one-versus-rest schemes.\n",
    "        - 'newton-cg', 'lbfgs', 'sag' and 'saga' handle L2 or no penalty\n",

    "        - Used to specify the norm used in the penalization. The 'newton-cg', 'sag' and 'lbfgs' solvers support only l2 penalties. 'elasticnet' is only supported by the 'saga' solver. If 'none' (not supported by the liblinear solver), no regularization is applied.\n",
